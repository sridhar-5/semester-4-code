3.Working with delays-Remove #10 after each input pair
and note down the changes in output

answer : found a noticable difference with a time delay of #10 all the four
rows in the truth table are displayed but without a timedelay only the
last row is found to be printed.

with time delay for xor gate: 
a=0,b=0,y=0
a=0,b=1,y=1
a=1,b=0,y=1
a=1,b=1,y=0

without timedelay for xor gate:
a=1,b=1,y=0
